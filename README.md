# Sparkling-Water-with-Python

Sparkling Water allows users to combine the fast, scalable machine learning algorithms of H2O with the capabilities of Spark. Spark is an elegant and powerful general-purpose, open-source, in-memory platform with tremendous momentum. H2O is an in-memory platform for machine learning that is reshaping how people apply math and predictive analytics to their business problems. Integrating these two open-source environments provides a seamless experience for users who want to make a query using Spark SQL, feed the results into H2O to build a model and make predictions, and then use the results again in Spark. For any given problem, better interoperability between tools provides a better experience.
